We will lite ourselves a flame  
Lite ourselves a flame as we kiss the sky

We set the fires to take us higher  
We set the fires to watch them burn  
Burn  
Burn  
Burn Burn Burn  
Let’s burn this bastard to the ground

You’re my deep obsession  
I'm the sweet depression  
I'm your muse

Make it burn

We are the voices that ignite the masses  
Scream for me, we are free

Strength in numbers, we encumber your dominion  
Rightfully, I wanna hear you scream  
Mercy please

I won’t stop  
Dead, or not  
We are the voices that ignite the fucking truth

We set the fires to take us higher  
We set the fires to watch them burn  
Burn!  
Burn!  
Burn Burn Burn  
Let’s Burn this bastard to the ground  
We set the fires to take us even higher  
We set the fires to watch them fucking burn  
Burn!  
Burn!  
Burn Burn Burn  
Let’s burn this bastard to the ground

Burn it to the ground  
Cleansing all the hate of the wicked  
Liberate our life from oppression

Come on  
Make it burn  
Come on  
Make it burn

We set the fires to take us higher  
we set the fires to watch them burn  
Burn!  
Burn!  
Burn Burn Burn  
Burn this bastard to the ground  
We set the fires to take us even higher  
we set the fires to watch them fucking burn  
Burn!  
Burn!  
Burn Burn Burn  
Let’s burn this bastard to the ground

We will lite ourselves a flame  
Lite ourselves a flame, as we kiss the sky
