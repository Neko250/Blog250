I know cities can be dirty and crowded and everything, but I like to come out here and look out over all the lights. It’s beautiful in its own way. It’s not nearly as infinite as the stars, but there is something about its humanness that adds a layer of wonderful complexity. Behind every light is a person with hope and fears and secrets… looking out is both terrifyingly lonely and fiercely personal. I think I love every person behind every window. I love you, people, for being my stars. I love you no matter how fucked up your life is or how far you think you’ve fallen. You are lovely for tonight...
