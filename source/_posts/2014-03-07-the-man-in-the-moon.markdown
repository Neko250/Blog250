### Mi poesía favorita, "El Hombre de la Luna Descendió con Premura".

The Man in the Moon had silver shoon,  
and his beard was of silver thread;  
With opals crowned and pearls all bound  
about his girdlestead,  
In his mantle grey he walked one day  
across a shining floor,  
And with crystal key in secrecy  
he opened an ivory door.

On a filigree stair of glimmering hair  
then lightly down he went,  
And merry was he at last to be free  
on a mad adventure bent.  
In diamonds white he had lost delight;  
he was tired of his minaret  
Of tall moonstone that towered alone  
on a lunar mountain set.

He would dare any peril for ruby and beryl  
to broider his pale attire,  
For new diadems of lustrous gems,  
emerald and sapphire.  
He was lonely too with nothing to do  
but stare at the world of gold  
And heark to the hum that would distantly come  
as gaily round it rolled.

At plenilune in his argent moon  
in his heart he longed for Fire:  
Not the limpid lights of wan selenites;  
for red was his desire,  
For crimson and rose and ember-glows,  
for flame with burning tongue,  
For the scarlet skies in a swift sunrise  
when a stormy day is young.

He’d have seas of blues, and the living hues  
of forest green and fen;  
And he yearned for the mirth of the populous earth  
and the sanguine blood of men.  
He coveted song, and laughter long,  
and viands hot, and wine,  
Eating pearly cakes of light snowflakes  
and drinking thin moonshine.

He twinkled his feet, as he tought of the meat,  
of pepper, and punch galore;  
And he tripped unaware on his slanting stair,  
and like a meteor,  
A star in flight, ere Yule one night  
flickering down he fell  
From his laddery path to a foaming bath  
in the windy Bay of Bel.

He began to think, lest he melt and sink,  
what in the moon to do,  
When a fisherman’s boat found him far afloat  
to the amazement of the crew,  
Caught in their net all shimmering wet  
in a phosphorescent sheen  
Of bluey whites and opals lights  
and delicate liquid green.

Against his wish with the morning fish  
they packed him back to land:  
‘You had best get a bed in an inn’, they said;  
‘the town is near at hand.’  
Only the knell of one slow bell  
high in the Seaward Tower  
Announced the news of his moonsick cruise  
at that unseemly hour.

Not a hearth was laid, not a breakfast made,  
and dawn was cold and damp.  
There were ashes for fire, and for grass the mire,  
for the sun a smoking lamp  
In a dim back-street. Not a man did he meet,  
no voice was raised in song;  
There were snores instead, for all folk were abed  
and still would slumber long.

He knocked as he passed on doors locked fast,  
and called and cried in vain,  
Till he came to an inn that had light within,  
and tapped at a window-pane.  
A drowsy cook gave a surly look,  
and ‘What do you want?’ said he.  
‘I want fire and gold and songs of old  
and red wine flowing free!’

‘You won’t get them here’, said the cook with a leer,  
‘but you may come inside.  
Silver I lack and silk to my back  
-maybe I’ll let you bide.’  
A silver gift the latch to lift,  
a pearl to pass the door;  
For a seat by the cook in the ingle-nook  
it cost him twenty more.

For hunger of drouth naught passed his mouth  
till he gave both crown and cloak;  
And all that he got, in an earthen pot  
broken and black with smoke,  
Was porridge cold and two days old  
to eat with a wooden spoon.

For puddings of Yule with plums, poor fool,  
he arrived so much too soon:  
An unwary guest on a lunatic quest  
from the Mountains of the Moon.
