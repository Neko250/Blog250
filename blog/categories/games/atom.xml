    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Videogames like this are the ones that I truly admire, the ones that make me want to make videogames&hellip; some day not too far away from here. These make an ART from games development. These are the ones that make you feel, that catch you into their stories. Are the ones that make you drop some tears.
I would totally recommend it to you (You do not even need to be a gamer to play and enjoy Papo &amp; Yo).</p>

<p>Here is the trailer, a synopsis, opinions and images from this little piece of art, this story I will not easily forget.</p>

<h3>Synopsis.</h3>

<p>The game tells the story of a kid named Quico, who gets involved in an adventure with his best friend, Monster, a beast who looks terrible, whilst is actually friendly. But Monster is an addict to eating poisonous frogs, what makes him wild and violent, even getting to attack his friends. Quico must go through a surrealist world, solving puzzles to find the cure for Monster. Papo &amp; Yo story is inspired in the Creative Director and Game Creator&rsquo;s personal life experiences, Vander Caballero, who reproduced the relationship with his alcoholic and abusive father using Quico and Monster characters. The last one&rsquo;s addiction to eating poisonous frogs and his personality changes would be a metaphor of Caballero&rsquo;s father addiction to alcohol and of the abuses Caballero received when he was a child.</p>

<h3>Critics.</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>PSLifeStyle: &ldquo;Papo &amp; Yo tells an incredibly personal story about love, loss and growth that serves as an example of how far the video game medium has come as an art form. Like any good story, the ending leaves some room for interpretation, and it can serve as a local point for discussions for a while to come.&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>Amber (Jugadora): &ldquo;Papo &amp; Yo touched my life in a big way. The ending was a sort of healing for me. Being able to roleplay through my unresolved childhood abuse issues in the safety of a video game has helped me to let go of a troubled childhood. I will never be the same. :) Thank you, Minority.&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>ArsTechnica: &ldquo;Like a hard-to-interpret dream that you just can&rsquo;t shake when you wake up, your mind will keep coming back to Papo &amp; Yo long after many other cookie-cutter action games have faded from your memory. For that alone, it&rsquo;s worth investing a bit of your life and money.&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>New York Times: &ldquo;Now Papo &amp; Yo, a lyrical trailer tale of a boy and a monster, has set a new and altogether standard in gaming for representing the world as it is.&rdquo;</p></li>
